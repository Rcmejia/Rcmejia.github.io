        <p class="lead mb-4">Expected to graduate from UCR in 2024<br><br>

        Originally from Northern California, born in the rural suburbs of Solano County. I was raised in Dixon, California, and surrounded by the farm life. Growing up it gave me plenty of perspectives on work ethic, and diligence since most tasks on a farm require grit, patience, and effort. From tending to the cute and high-maintenance animals to clearing out fields of dry weeds 4 feet tall everything required patience and effort to accomplish the goal. Luckily these traits carried on into college as I moved to the more urban Southern California to attend UC Riverside. Although I found myself doing zero hours of hard labor I still found these traits that I earned through my childhood carried into my education and work life. Now I am a fourth year planning to graduate from UC Riverside having held numerous positions in my fraternity, Delta Chi.<br><br>

        As I transition from college life to the workforce I look forward to creating positive change in my local community. Community service and giving back are my passions since I have always enjoyed helping others. My goal in life is to establish a series of laundry mats that target to help less fortunate families in underserved communities. I aim to create a clean and sanitary environment for families and individuals in need of clean laundry. Lack of care, compassion, and unaware owners have caused an influx in unsafe and unhygienic spaces that are not welcoming for working-class families. Why do I care? My biggest belief is to do good, and good will come back to you. Regardless of the scale of the help, by helping others you will in turn be rewarded in positive ways.
